# Feature Request: Performance Improvements

The specifications mention optional enhancements such as caching, bulk operations, and multi-process support for heavy workloads.

### Performance Improvements

As usage scales, we might consider:

* **Caching:** Implementing caching at the service layer for certain requests. E.g., if `GetNodeStatus` is called frequently, the controller could cache results for a short time to avoid hitting a slow sensor each time. This can be done within the controller or via an added caching layer.
* **Bulk Operations:** Defining new commands that handle bulk data to reduce overhead. The architecture supports this as just another command, but it’s a design consideration at the API level.
* **Parallel Processing:** On multi-core devices, Python’s GIL limits one process’s CPU-bound concurrency. If we needed to utilize multiple cores, we could run multiple processes of the server (each with perhaps a portion of the commands or behind a load-balancer approach). Reticulum doesn’t natively load-balance (since a given destination hash is served by one instance), but one could assign different tasks to different nodes or use threading carefully for CPU tasks. Alternatively, critical sections could be moved to native code or use Python’s multiprocessing for heavy tasks.
```

Implementing these optimizations could significantly improve throughput on larger deployments.
